Hi! Iâ€™m James McEwan, a Front End Engineer from Scotland.

I love building things for the web, with a passion for performant, accessible apps, JavaScript, CSS, and all the Jamstack goodness.

I'm also avid fan of comic books, coffee, mechanical keyboards, backpacks, and stationary. In my spare time I enjoy illustrating using either traditional mediums or digitally on my iPad Pro.
